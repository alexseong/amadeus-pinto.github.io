#Forecasting Daily Fantasy Gamblers' Picks Based on the News

##Introduction

In October of 2015, an employee of the daily fantasy sports (DFS) gambling site DraftKings leveraged his site's user data to win $350,000 on a competitor site, FanDuel, resulting in [allegations of insider trading and concern over the potential for further abuses committed by an unregulated industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/sports/fanduel-draftkings-fantasy-employees-bet-rivals.html?_r=0). 

In a zero-sum game, knowledge of opponents' positions (the field's picks) ahead of market (the contest) represents a serious advantage (or serious abuse when applied by the same people making the market). The expected value of pick I, ```V(pick_I)```, is a product of the probability ```P``` of pick I's success and its associated payout ```p```:

	V(pick_I) = sum_J P(S_J)*p(S_J;w_I).

```P(S_J)``` is the probability of pick I's score J,``` S_J```, and is independent of gamblers' perceptions, whereas payout ```p``` depends on pick I's score and gamblers' collective valuation of I, where ```w_I``` represents the "market share" (also "weight" or "ownership") in pick I. ```{w_I}``` is the quantity of interest here, and models projecting field ownerships ahead of market are the goal of this project. 

Apart from the intrinsic neatness of explaining/predicting the decisions a collection of people make given incomplete information and perceived utility, knowledge of athlete market shares can potentially help one accurately project outcomes of entire fantasy contests themselves... Specifically, if one has a "good" estimate of the covariance matrix of athlete fantasy output, one can collect statistics from an ensemble of Monte-Carlo-sampled contests, each one represented in a set of tickets giving rise to the predicted market. A basic application of such a simulation would be ranking the tickets by probability of profitability, etc.

##The Long and Short of DFS Mechanics

"Fantasy owners" (the gamblers) submit one or multiple ticket(s) of athletes' names together satisfying a set of constraints (e.g., on the total fantasy salary of the athletes, fantasy positions, etc.) to an online site (a.k.a. the bookie - FanDuel, DraftKings, etc.) which takes a rake and pays out a subset of tickets as a function of ticket score, determined by athletes' accumulated game stats after bets are locked. 

Broadly, there are two (very different) contest types: a "tournament" game pays out the top ~20%, with payout odds growing ~exponentially from 1:1 at the ~20th percentile line (a typical first place ticket's return is ~1000:1); a "cash" game pays out the top ~50% fixed 1:1 odds. Naturally, these payouts force fantasy owners to favor higher-variance players (riskier positions) in "tournaments" and lower-variance players (safer positions) in "cash" games. This causes lower-mean/higher-variance distributions of ticket scores in the former and higher-mean/lower-variance distributions in the latter. See [this](https://www.fanduel.com/nba-guide?t=rules) FanDuel tutorial for more (or less).

##Project Specifics

What causes gamblers to make the choices they make with the information they have, and how accurately can I predict the field of wagers in a given contest? 

I set out to answer these questions using scraped contest records of field ownerships in past FanDuel NBA contests (thanks to [@brainydfs](http://brainydfs.com/)), historic athlete performance data from [sportsdatabase.com](http://sportsdatabase.com/), the news leading up to the particular contest (e.g., "industry" fantasy output projections from [BasketballMonster](http://basketballmonster.com) and [FantasyCrunchers](http://fantasycrunchers.com), and available injury/roster reports), and elements of the DFS game mechanics presumed to impact gamblers' decisions. (These and others are detailed in the __Models__ section below.) 

I trained and validated ~400 player-centered models (estimators include ridge, lasso, random forest, and gradient-boosted regressors) on over 700 "tournament" contests from the 2016 season and the first two months of the 2017 season, holding out January 2017 slates for tests.

## Results
  * __training/validating player-centered models__

   Below is a plot of athletes' average ownerships against their standard deviations. Colors correspond to groups coming out of a k-Means decomposition (k=5) of the matrix of player models by respective model coefficients. Clustering of player models (only implicitly included in the model parameters) indicates similar model composition among athletes in close proximity on the mean-standard deviation plane. In other words, it turns out that common factors drive (un)popular athletes' market share. High-mean, high-spread clusters (colored light blue and light green) include Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and LeBron James ownership models, among others you could probably name... Their ownership models depend on, among others, the ```slate_size``` variable similarly (steeply inversely; see the __Models__ section below).

   The predictive power of an ownership model increases with mean ownership (and also with the spread around ownership): 
   ![alt text](https://github.com/amadeus-pinto/forecasting-daily-fantasy-gambler-picks-based-on-the-news/blob/master/ANALYSIS/KMEANS/FIGS/mu.ratio.Lasso.gpp.png)
   
   This means ownerships of athletes who typically dominate the market share are predicted more accurately. On the other hand, athletes with higher-variance ownerships (specifically, lower mean-to-standard deviation ratio types) are more difficult to predict.

  * __player models in hold-out__
  
  I held out contests from January 2017 for testing. Predicted versus true ownerships for each ownership observation are plotted below, with colors corresponding to athlete position, and where perfect predictions would lie on the line ```predicted ownership=true ownership```. 
  ![alt text](https://github.com/amadeus-pinto/forecasting-daily-fantasy-gambler-picks-based-on-the-news/blob/master/ANALYSIS/SLATES/FIGS/jan.RandomForestRegressor.gpp.png)
  Compare these predictions with the null model, which guesses the player's mean ownership each observation:

  * __bundled predictions of whole-tournament means__

  Player models are doing great, but player models are hardly useful in a vacuum... 
  A useful question to ask is: How well do market share predictions _taken together_ predict the market? A contest's average fantasy score ```<S>``` is an appropriate quantity for this purpose since it couples the ```{w}``` explicitly,

        <S> = sum_K w_K*S_K.

  ```S_K``` and ```w_K``` are athlete fantasy scores and ownerships, respectively. In the limit predicted minus true ```{w}``` go to zero, all that's left to _analytically_ determine the exact contest mean fantasy score are the ```{S}```, which depend on NBA players alone. Below are predicted versus true contest means for unseen January 2017. Each point is a contest mean computed from the collection of independent player ownerships (actual and predicted) belonging to that contest. Perfect contest mean predictions would lie on the line ```predicted < contest score > = true < contest score >```. 

  ![alt text](https://github.com/amadeus-pinto/forecasting-daily-fantasy-gambler-picks-based-on-the-news/blob/master/ANALYSIS/SLATES/FIGS/field.Lasso.gpp.png)

  Substituting null-model ownerships in the tournament mean equation, predicted means are wildly unrealistic.

## Outlook

  In view of their performances in hold-out tests, player ownership models and bundled contest predictions seem to enjoy a great degree of predictive power... 

  Efforts to improve accuracy might focus on introducing more features, and/or linearly-combining models of player ownerships. 

  To the first point, given the relatively high impact of "industry" player valuations on ownership models, inclusion of daily projections from more sources, e.g., [RotoGrinders](https://rotogrinders.com/), [fb-ninja](www.fb-ninja.com), and any number of others, preferably in order of decreasing volume of their subscription base (after all, the same people buying into industry projections are the same people using these numbers to gamble in contests, and the same people generating the dependent variable modeled here) should increase accuracy.   

  To the second point, lower-variance ownership predictions are probably obtainable via [stacked regression](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/367.pdf). I trained four estimators: lasso (L1), ridge (L2), random forest, and gradient-boosted regressors. The correlation matrix of their test-set (January hold-out) residuals is plotted below. Surprisingly, lasso and ridge regressors aren't too positively correlated, which isn't the case with the ensemble models. A preliminary investigation of a solution via stacked regression might check errors of an equally-weighted composite model against individual models' errors.

   This type of feature is arguably the most interesting, and without a doubt among the most predictive. It is constructed as follows:
   For each contest, initialize a set of "fictitious gamblers", each with a specified "worldview" (tuning bias), some measure of "risk tolerance" (tuning variance), and number of bets. For each fictitious gambler, solve the integer programming problem of constructing a number of unique bets, each maximizing projected fantasy points (enumerated by worldview) subject to feasibility constraints (FanDuel's salary cap, position requirements, etc.) and risk tolerance constraints (maximum number of athelete overlaps with previous integer programming solution in fictitous gambler's portfolio). For each athlete in the slate, construct a feature set of fictitious holdings, each entry of which is the proportion of the fictitious portfolio in that athlete.

### Feature Importance

To better understand which features are important for ownership models, I computed the percentage of time a feature is in the top 5 over all player models. ('top 5' is defined for ensemble models as the 5 features with the highest gini importance, and for linear models, as the 5 features with the highest absolute-magnitude coefficients). They're tabulated for each estimator below.
